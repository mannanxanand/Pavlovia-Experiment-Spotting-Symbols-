# Pavlovia-Experiment-Spotting-Symbols-
My experiment for supervised research on Visual Cognition under Nobel Laureate Dr. Leeland Hartwell involved challenging participants with cards with varying number of symbols which they were asked to match within a time constraint. This was aimed to gather data on how much information an individual can store in complex visual environments. 

This experiment runs on JavaScript and Python. It was created on Psychopy and hosted on Pavlovia.
Utilize the .js, HTML and CSS files to run it on the web- ideally you will want to use the provided link (https://run.pavlovia.org/anandm/spottingsymbols/) to run the web version of this experiment.

Utilize the .py to run the experiment locally in any supported Windows or Mac laptop.

Alternatively, for those not adept with coding can use the .psyexp file on Psychopy's builder to make changes to the experiment's routines and loops. For more information visit https://psychopy.org/documentation.html
